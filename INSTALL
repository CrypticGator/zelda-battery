Welcome to ZBatt,

# Building

Unix-like systems, enter the `nix' directory and run:

1. autoreconf -fi
2. ./configure
3. make

Windows systems, enter the `win' directory and run:

1. autoreconf -fi
2. ./configure
3. make

Some configure options worth noting:

1. --enable-debug, --disable-debug

   Turns on/off debug messages (disabled by default)

   I recommend using this option, or going into `src/main.h` and setting
   `ZB_DEBUG' to 0, since I sometimes forget to turn off debugging
   when I make a release.

>   # ifndef ZB_DEBUG
>   #  define ZB_DEBUG 1
>   # endif

2. --without-gtk2, --with-gtk2

   Enables/disables building ZBatt's graphical frontend (enabled by default)

3. --enable-native, --disable-native

   Enables/disables the `-march=native' `-mtune=native' options to the compiler (enabled by default)
   If your compiler doesn't support these options, disable them.

4. --enable-generic, --disable-generic
   Enables/disables compilation for your system's generic processor type (disabled by default)


To build ZBatt, run:

autoreconf -i
./configure --disable-debug
make

# Installation

After building ZBatt, install it thusly:

make install

NOTE: you can use `DESTDIR' to specify a particular installation directory.
